      About the Royal Kingdom of Colchis
    </h2>
    <p>
      In pre-Helenistic Greco-Roman geography, Colchis was an exonym for the Georgian polity of the Black Sea, centered in present-day western Georgia.
      It has been described in modern scholarship as "the earliest Georgian formation" which, along with the Kingdom of Iberia,would later contribute
      significantly to the Georgian nation.</br>
      Colchis is Know in the Greek mythology as the destination of the Argonauts, as well as the home of Medea and the Golden Flece.It was also described
      as the landrich with gold,iron,timber and honey that would export its resources mostly to ancient Hellenic city-states. 
      Colchis was populated by  Colchians,an early Kartvelia-speaking tribe to the contemporary western Georgians, namely Svans ans Zans. Its geography 
      is mostly assigned to what is now the western part of Georgia and encompasses the present-day Georgian provinces of Samegrelo,Imereti,Guria,Adjara,
      Abkhazia,Svaneti,Racha;modern Russia's Sochi andTuapse districts;ans present-day Turkey's Artvin, Rise and Trabzon provinces.
